## What is Codevember?
Codevember is a challenge by [Arthur Rob](https://twitter.com/Arth_Rob) and [Valentin Daguenet](https://twitter.com/vdaguenet) which invites developers to post a new creative piece of code for every day of November.

The [Codevember website](http://codevember.xyz) has a list of hints for each day of the month, e.g. *1. Infinity*, *2. Time* and *3. Carrot*. Using the hint, participants come up with a creative bit of code inspired by the word. For example, for the hint *Music*, you could create a usable piano with JavaScript.

## Why should I do Codevember?
Here are a few reasons why you should partake:
- Gives you a chance to experiment with new technologies that you might not always have a chance to
- Helps expand your knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript whilst having fun
- After 30 days you will have a collection of code creations that you can be proud of

## How can I do Codevember?
The Codevember team aim to make the challenge as accessible as possible and allow you to submit your creations using any platform/tool you like.

If you want to get your work featured on the Codevember website, you can do so in a few ways. To attempt [Codevember on Codier](https://codier.io/challenge/codevember-2018), post a solution each day with the hashtag #codevember and the day of the month e.g. *#codevember - 12 - My awesome work*. CodePen users can get their pen's featured with the same title format. Alternatively, you can [submit your work](http://codevember.xyz/about) directly to the Codevember site.

And don't worry if you have missed a day or two, you can join in whenever!
